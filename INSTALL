Installation and use of the Cornell Canine Simulator

Installation of the software for this simulator requires acceptance and compliance with
the software license described in the LICENSE file. Please read the license before
installation.

The software was designed for operation on an Ubuntu Desktop installed computer. Our
initial development used Ubuntu 14.04 on an x86 system. 

In addition to the basic Desktop installation, you will need to install the following
packages:

	GIT
	LAMP Stack:
		Apache 2
		MySQL 5.5
		PHP 5.5
	phpmyadmin
	GNU C++ Compiler (g++)
	CGICC 
	Open SSH Server
	Opera
	
Git:

	$ sudo apt-get install git
	
The LAMP Stack (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) can be installed using the following commands:

	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install lamp-server^
	
Alternatively, you could install the separate components as detailed below.
	
PHPMYADMIN:
Execute the following command:
	$ sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin
	
If asked, select the Apache web server to be reconfigured.
	
After the install completes, create a link from the 'www' directory to the location of phpmyadmin:

	$ sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/html/
	

GNU C++ Compiler:
From your server console, execute the following commands:
	$ sudo apt-get update	(Note: not needed if you did this step earlier)
	$ sudo apt-get install g++

OpenSSH Server:

	$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
	
CGICC:
(from https://singhgurjot.wordpress.com/2012/05/14/how-to-use-cgicommon-gateway-interface-for-c-programming-in-ubuntu/)
The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol for enabling applications 
(called CGI programs or CGI scripts) to interact with Web servers and with clients. 
The software uses the CGICC library to build CGI programs in C++.

To install CGICC files follow the steps given as:
1. Open the terminal, and type the following commands-
	$ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/cgicc/cgicc-3.0.tar.gz
	$ tar xvf cgicc-3.0.tar.gz
	$ sudo -s
	# mv cgicc-3.0 /usr/include
	# apt-get install build-essential libcgicc5 libcgicc5-dev libcgicc-doc
	# apt-get update

To configure apache web server for CGI wdit the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf 
to include the following within the VirtualHost definition:

	<Directory "/var/www/html/cgi-bin">
		AllowOverride None
		Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>

Chrome:
	$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera.list'
	$ sudo sh -c 'wget -O - http://deb.opera.com/archive.key | apt-key add -'
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install opera
	


Build and Install the Canine Simulator:

	$ make install
	
---------------------------------------
Alternate install for LAMP components:
The Apache, PHP5 and MySQL instructions are based on the content at
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-14-04. 
You can visit that page for more details.


Apache2: 
From your server console, execute the following commands:

	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install apache2

At this point, you should be able to open the default web page on you system. Check it with http://[your_server_IP_address.


MySQL:
From your server console, execute the following commands:
	$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server php5-mysql
	$ sudo mysql_install_db

The next step will set a password for the "root" account in MySQL. This is not the same as the "root"
account for linux. Be sure to write down the password.

	$ sudo mysql_secure_installation


PHP:
From your server console, execute the following command:
	$ sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mcrypt
	
The web page we referenced above recommends adding "index.php" in the Directory Index in the
file /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf. This is optional.

Now, restart the Apache2 server:

	$ sudo service apache2 restart
