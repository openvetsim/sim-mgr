This directory contains the files required for the "Tsunami Super WAV Trigger"
used in the Simulator Controller. 

For details on the Tsunami, see the Product Page at http://robertsonics.com/tsunami/ and
the User Guide at http://robertsonics.com/tsunami-user-guide/.


Files in ths directory:
	*.wav - Sounds used for auscultation and vocalizations
	tsunami.ini - Tsunami Configuration
	tsunamix.hex - Tsunami Mono Firmware
	soundList.csv - sound reference list, used by sim-ctl for lookup of sounds and cross reference to file numbers. Also
	                used in TeleSim mode.
	
The files of this directory should be copied to a FAT16 or FAT32 formatted MicroSD card 
and installed in the Tsunami. The MicroSD card should be speed class 4 or 10, non-UHS.
See http://robertsonics.com/microsd-cards-for-audio/ for details.

For TeleSim, the content is also copied to /var/www/html/sim-sounds.


The Tsunami is used in Mono mode, but is initialy installed with Stereo firmware. To load the
new firmware:

	1. Put the card into Tsunami and make sure Tsunami is powered.
	2. Press and hold the user button and then tap the reset button.
	   Wait for Tsunamiâ€™s LED to go on solid.
	3. Release the user button and tap the reset button, or power-cycle the Tsunami.
	You should now be running the new firmware.
