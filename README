Note: We recommend using WinVetSim under Windows 10/11 rather than using this Linux based sim-mgr software. We have ceased
development on sim-mgr.

This file describes the functions of the programs created in this directory

simmgr
	A daemon task to generate the base timing of the Simulator system and to provide the levels
	the Vitals Display. simmagr opens and created the SHM file. The SHM file is the central 
	interchange for commands in from the Instructor Interface and status out to all consumers.
	
	simmgr executes the scenario manager. On startup, it starts the "default" scenario. 
	
simstatus
	A CGI task, called via the II to pass commands in and to get status. It communicates through the SHM file.
	
	simstatus installs in the cgi-bin directory.
	
/run/shm/simmgr
	Shared Memory File for the Simulation Manager. Referred to as the SHM file, this is created by
	the simmgr. The file is read/write by all applications that access it, but individual values
	should never have more than one writer. This file is created and initialized by simmgr.
	
includes/simmgr.h
	The content of the SHM file is defined here. Other common definitions for the simmgr system are also
	provided in this header file.
	
src/simstatus.cpp
	Source file for simstatus.cgi.
	
src/simmgr.cpp
	Source file for simmgr.
	
src/simutil.c
	Common functions shared by Simulation Manager programs
